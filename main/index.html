			<h1 id="Carrion">Carrion Crow</h1>
			
            <p>The carrion crow (<i>Corvus corone</i>) is a corvid found in western Europe and Eastern Asia. It is around 48-52 cm in length, weighs around 400-600 grams and has a wingspan of around 84-100 cm. The Plumage of carrion crows is black with a green or purple sheen. As in their name, they eat mostly carrion. They will eat insects, earthworms, grain, fruit, nuts, seeds, small mammals, fish, amphibians, and eggs. They scavenge a lot of their food, although sometimes they actively hunt, even occasionally with other crows. Their average age is around 4 years, but they have been known to live at least 14 years in the wild. The carrion crow is, like all corvids, very intelligent. </p>

            <h1>Hooded Crow</h1>

            <p>The hooded crow (<i>Corvus cornix</i>) is a Corvid found across most of Europe, as well as a few places in the Middle East. It was formerly a subspecies of the <a href="#Carrion">carrion crow</a>. However, in 2002 it was elevated to full status, after the species were observed to be less similar than previusly thought. The plumage is grey, with contrasting black wings, head & tail. Its length is around 44-51 cm, the wingspan 84 to 105 cm, and the weight is around 430 to 650 g. Its diet is similar to the carrion crow. They are known to drop hard-shelled molluscs from heights to crack them open. The hooded crow is a very interesting bird.</p>
