			<h1>Common Raven</h1>
			
            <p>The common raven (<i>Corvus corax</i>) is a large, all-black passerine bird with the widest distribution of any corvid, found across the Northern Hemisphere.  The common raven is one of the two largest corvid species, alongside the thick-billed raven, and may be the heaviest passerine bird, averaging 63 centimeters in length and 1.47 kilograms at maturity, with a average wingspan of around 116 to 153 cm. Although their typical lifespan is considerably shorter, around  10 years, common ravens can live at most 23 years in the wild. The common raven is known to replicate other noises in their environment, including those produced by humans. Young birds may travel in flocks, but later mate for life, with each pair defending its own territory.</p>

			<h1 id="Carrion">Carrion Crow</h1>
			
            <p>The carrion crow (<i>Corvus corone</i>) is a corvid found in western Europe and Eastern Asia. It is around 48-52 cm in length, weighs around 400-600 grams and has a wingspan of around 84-100 cm. The Plumage of carrion crows is black with a green or purple sheen. As in their name, they eat mostly carrion. They will eat insects, earthworms, grain, fruit, nuts, seeds, small mammals, fish, amphibians, and eggs. They scavenge a lot of their food, although sometimes they actively hunt, even occasionally with other crows. Their average age is around 4 years, but they have been known to live at least 14 years in the wild. The carrion crow is, like all corvids, very intelligent. </p>

            <h1>Hooded Crow</h1>

            <p>The hooded crow (<i>Corvus cornix</i>) is a Corvid found across most of Europe, as well as a few places in the Middle East. It was formerly a subspecies of the <a href="#Carrion">carrion crow</a>. However, in 2002 it was elevated to full status, after the species were observed to be less similar than previusly thought. The plumage is grey, with contrasting black wings, head & tail. Its length is around 44-51 cm, the wingspan 84 to 105 cm, and the weight is around 430 to 650 g. Its diet is similar to the carrion crow. They are known to drop hard-shelled molluscs from heights to crack them open. The hooded crow is a very interesting bird.</p>
