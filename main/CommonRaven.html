			<h1>Common Raven</h1>
			
            <p>The common raven (<i>Corvus corax</i>) is a large, all-black passerine bird with the widest distribution of any corvid, found across the Northern Hemisphere.  The common raven is one of the two largest corvid species, alongside the thick-billed raven, and may be the heaviest passerine bird, averaging 63 centimeters in length and 1.47 kilograms at maturity, with a average wingspan of around 116 to 153 cm. Although their typical lifespan is considerably shorter, around  10 years, common ravens can live at most 23 years in the wild. The common raven is known to replicate other noises in their environment, including those produced by humans. Young birds may travel in flocks, but later mate for life, with each pair defending its own territory.</p>
